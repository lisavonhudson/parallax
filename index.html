Althought the notion of premiums, co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance have become second nature to many healthcare consumers, the average consumer is in need of a more in-depth education.</p>

When considering the rollout of healthcare.gov, and the amount of press that it has since received, the idea of credibility has become more importnat than ever within the healthcare exchange business.  The shareholders must believe the exchange is going to work and be successful, and avoid engaging with vendors whose marketing materials may ultimately outpace its actual resume.</p>

Realizing revenue or staying revenue neutral is this group's primary return on investment.  However, beneficiary satisfaction - the promise of the private exchange - is just as important as adding new products as a means of growing their revenue base.  A positive user experience has the  potential to develop into long-term client success and new commission streams.</p>

					<h2>Meaningful product choice</h2>
					<p>Although the term 'meaningful' may represent different things to different people, meaningful choice and flexibility for the broker starts with the availability of medical, voluntary, and ancillary products.  As medical commissions decrease, brokers are seeing enormous value in discovering additional revenue sources while delivering meaningful choice to their exchange participants.  As individual consumers further thier medical decision-making authority, they are realizing the value of voluntary and ancillary supplement choices that effect other aspects of their life beyond health insurance.</p>
